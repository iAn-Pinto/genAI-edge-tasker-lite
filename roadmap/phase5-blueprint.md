Objective
- Improve startup and runtime performance; enhance accessibility and UX polish.

Performance
- Add Baseline Profile module and macrobenchmark
- Enable configuration cache and Gradle optimizations

- Add i18n support with a sample secondary locale and pseudolocalization

UX & Theming

- Accessibility scanner reports no critical issues
- UI adapts to large screens; theme toggles work

Artifacts
- :baselineprofile and :benchmark modules
- Updated themes and layouts
- Accessibility test checklist in docs
